# ReleaseNotesGenerator
[![.NET Framework](https://github.com/Ali3nSVK/ReleaseNotesGenerator/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Ali3nSVK/ReleaseNotesGenerator/actions/workflows/dotnet.yml)
## Purpose
Generates release notes from subversion commit messages as part of a CI/CD pipeline.
* Requires SVN installed and set up in PATH.
  * Does not require checkouts or local working copies.
* Outputs HTML formatted report.
* XML config for repo and options setup.

## Usage
Just run it and follow instructions.
It is however very project specific and not exactly reusable.
